Encouragement and Confidence: Expressing confidence in Carla's abilities (""You can do this, I know you can"") boosts her self-esteem and reassures her that she's capable of completing the assignment. This positive reinforcement can help her push through the challenges she's facing. Collaborative Effort: Offering to work together reduces the pressure Carla might feel, making the task seem less overwhelming. It turns the session into a collaborative effort, which can make her feel supported and less alone in her struggle. Incentive to Share: The incentive of discussing her scarf designs afterward provides an extrinsic motivator.

Meaningful Reward: The reward of talking about baseball for 10 minutes is directly tied to Kevin's interests and passions.

Personal Connection: Asking Kevin about his baseball season shows genuine interest in his life outside of academics. This helps build a stronger, more personal connection, making Kevin feel valued and understood. When students feel that their interests are acknowledged and respected, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated. Creating Positive Associations: By linking the completion of math work with a positive experience (talking about baseball), Kevin will start to associate math with positive outcomes. This can help shift his mindset towards viewing math in a more positive light.

I'm here to help you every step of the way. Let's work through these problems together, and soon you'll see how math can be both fun and useful in your fashion projects. You've got this, Carla!
